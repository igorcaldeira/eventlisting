Contact list App using [Ionic](http://ionic.io/?utm_source=framework&utm_medium=navbar&utm_campaign=platform%20CTA) - created for [Gama Academy Bootcamp](https://www.facebook.com/gamaacademybr/videos/873276939466555/) (Hacker Stack).

Our challenge was to build a simple contact list app using a technology that none of us had experience.
The deadline for this project (beginning to end) was 2 days.

This is the mobile version of the app. For the Web version see: https://github.com/danfaiole/lista-ionic

Here is our app. We hope you enjoy it!
